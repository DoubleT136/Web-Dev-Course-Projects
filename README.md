1. This Git repository contains most of the work I have done for comp 20 in Spring 2016, which includes assignments and labs.

2. My favorite assignment was the Assignment 3, the Landmarks-server assignment. I felt like the assignment was challenging, yet not unfair. And the end result was extremely rewarding. I feel like I learned a lot from struggling with an event-driven language such as Javascript.

3. I have learned the fundamentals on how different devices on the internet communicate each other, gained an in depth knowledge on HTML and CSS, and learned both client-side and server-side javascript. Finally, I learned about the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications and how to exploit them. But more importantly, I learned how to read documentations efficiently and use existing modules for my own needs. I think I am a better programmer, and this course has set me up well for future web-related works.

4. As I said above, the most important thing that I learned was how to look for the right tool, read the documentation, and use that tool when facing a problem. For example, in the group project, to make sure one device can vote on one food item once, I used a Node packages that managed cookie and another package that generated a random userID. Another example is using the mongo driver for both Assignment 3 and the group project. I had to look up a lot of the features on my own and learn to use them. I think this will help me greatly in the future.

5. I would like delve deeper into security, since I think it has a promising future and it is extremely fun to try to find security vulnerabilities. Good thing I'm taking security next semester ^.^
