This Git repository contains most of the work I have done for comp 20 in Spring 2016, which includes assignments and labs. The most noteworthy project is **landmarks-server**, which uses mongoDB, Node.js and Google Maps API among others to host a server on Heroku that allowed users to check-in at different coordinates and display them on a map. **security** was my security and privacy report generated by attempting to hack another student's landmarks-server.
