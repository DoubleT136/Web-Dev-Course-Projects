                <h1>Security Assessment of Landmarks</h1>
                <p>Written by Chao Tang, 4/27/2016</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This assessment tests the security and privacy of client-Side and server-Side of my partner's (Jeremy Colebrook-Soucie) Landmarks assignment. The client-side of the code uses the Google Maps API and the geolocation API to send the user name and current location of the user to the landmarks server, and then display the JSON response on the map. The server-side of the assignment uses MongoDB to store information on 18246 landmarks and users who have made requests to the site. It handles POST request from the client-side by adding the user to the database and sending back all user information and landmarks within a mile. The index page shows all users who have checked in. And there is also a /checkins.json that takes an username as query parameter and returns all the times this user has checked in.</p>
                <p>In this assessment, I consider security issues as issues that distrupt the intended operations of the web applications, and I consider privacy issues as issues where information that should be hidden is exposed.</p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>I first performed "black-box" testing on the both sides of the assignment using curl and my browser, testing for obvious vulnerabilities and "curling" all kinds of invalid requests. Then, I tried scanning the website with a vulnerability scanner, OWSAP ZAP. Unfortunately, ZAP only returned three issues, all of which did not really matter for this assignment (ex. clickjacking). Finally, I reviewed my partner's server-side source code and performed further "white-box" testing.</p>

                <h2>Abstraction of findings</h2>
                <p>Most of the issues found are casued by blindly trusting user input without first verifying it. These vulnerabilities can have a range of effects on both the server-side web application, including exposing all user data, changing the behaviour of the website, and outright crashing the server. In turn, this can affect the client-side by displaying the wrong information or refusing to connect.</p>

                <h2>Issues Found</h2>

                <h3>1. Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
                <p>Affects GET on the index page</p>
                <p>Severity: High (Security Issue)</p>
                <p>Consequences: Allows attackers to inject client-side javascript code into web pages served to the client, which will be executed when a client accesses the index page.<br/>
                Example: Using the the curl command "curl --data &quot;login=&lt;script&gt;alert()&lt;/script&gt;&amp;lng=-71.1200&amp;lat=42.40881&quot; http://thepowerfulsunblindsme.herokuapp.com/sendLocation" and then accessing the server index page via browser shows this result:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="xss_alert.png" alt="XSS result" /></p>
                <p>This is one of the most common vulnerabilities on the internet, and it is casued by not sanitizing user input from POST properly. Specifically, the "login" field in the POST request can contain javascript code. In the right hands, this exploit can be used to crash the user browser or even bypass same-origin policy of another web application. I found this issue by trying different curl commands to /sendLocation.</p>
                <p>Solution: Sanitize the login field by putting in the following line immediately after parsing the request: "login = login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, &#39;&#39;);"</p>

                <h3>2. HTML Injection</h3>
                <p>Affects GET on the index page and the client-side web page</p>
                <p>Severity: High (Security Issue)</p>
                <p>Consequences: Similar to the XSS mentioned above, this vulnerability allows attackers to inject HTML elements and code into web pages through POST parameters, which will then be executed when a client accesses the index page and in the Google Maps API on the client-side. Furthermore, malicious code can be embedded in pictures or other sources.</p>
                <p>Example: Using the curl command "curl --data &quot;login=&lt;img src=&#39;https://i.imgflip.com/vw7te.jpg&#39;&gt;&amp;lng=-71.1200&amp;lat=42.40879&quot; http://thepowerfulsunblindsme.herokuapp.com/sendLocation" and then accessing the server index page shows this result:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="html_serverside.png" alt="HTML injection server side result" /></p>
                <p>Accessing the client-side web page shows this:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="html_clientside.png" alt="HTML injection client side result" /></p>
                <p>Again, this is caused by not sanitizing input from POST properly. Since it's not scripts that's being injected, the potential damage that can be done is limited. However, it can still cause uninted behaviour for clients viewing the website. I found this issue by trying different curl commands to /sendLocation.</p>
                <p>Solution: Sanitize the login field by putting in the following line immediately after parsing the request: "login = login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, &#39;&#39;);"</p>

                <h3>3. NOSQL Injections</h3>
                <p>Affects /checkins.json (Privacy Issue)</p>
                <p>Severity: Very High</p>
                <p>Consequences: Anyone is able to access the checkin information of all users through /checkins.json, which is abolutely not the intended behaviour and a huge privacy issue.</p>
                <p>Example: By entering "http://thepowerfulsunblindsme.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=" in any browser, attacker is able to get all checkins without actually needing any logins. The result is as follows:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="nosql.png" alt="NOSQL injection result" /></p>
                <p>This is exploit is because of the way mongodb queries are handled. In line 68 of index.js, the query "db.collection(&#39;userdata&#39;).find({login:userLogin})" gets interpreted as "db.collection(&#39;userdata&#39;).find({login:{$ne:&quot;&quot;}})" with the request shown in the example, thus it will return all entrys where the login is not empty. I found this by messing with the query input, and consulting Ming (and his video at DEFCON).</p>
                <p>Solution: To avoid queries like this, the query has to be sanitized beforehand, either using a regular expression similar to the ones above or an outside library.</p>

                <h3>4. Server crash on invalid JSON</h3>
                <p>Affects EVERYTHING, both client-side and server-side (Security Issue)</p>
                <p>Severity: Very High</p>
                <p>Consequences: Upon sending TWO POST requests in a row (For unknown reasons, one request will not work) containing invalid JSON parameters (lat=,), the web application crashes and trying to interact with it in anyway gives an Application Error. As a result, the client-side fails to work properly as well. This persists until a server reboot (or around 30 mins on heroku). </p>
                <p>Example: Sending two curl requests as follows results in the behavior shown below:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="json_post.png" alt="Invalid JSON example" /></p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="json_get.png" alt="Invalid JSON result" /></p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, this is NOT because of not sanitizing user input. Instead it is because of a bug in my partner's code. In line 31 and 32 in index.js, he uses parseFloat() when parsing the lng and lat, which returns NaN if it detects a char that is not a digit. However, later he queries the db with these parameters in line 45 and 49. The query functions return an err upon seeing NaN, and my partner was smart to check for err. However, in line 46 and 56 when he checks for error and sends a response, the program continues after the if statement, thus it ends up trying to send two responses. Since this is illegal, the web server crashes. I found this when trying different curl commands.</p>
                <p>Solution: Simply modify the code and wrap everything after the if(err) statments in else statements as follows:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="json_fix.png" alt="Invalid JSON fix" /></p>

                <h3>5. MongoLab username and password exposed</h3>
                <p>Affects EVERYTHING, both client-side and server-side (Security Issue)</p>
                <p>Severity: Low</p>
                <p>Consequences: Allow attacker access to the database through mongo shell directly, allowing him to modify data stored, add new entries to the database, etc. </p>
                <p>Example: In the screenshot below, I am showing a document I added in a collection that I created, as well as the userdata collection:</p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="mongo_exposed.png" alt="Directly using mongo shell example" /></p>
                <p>In index.js, line 11, the mongoUri is an absolute Uri typed in plain text, showing the username and passowrd of the database to anyone who can acess this file. In addition, there is also a mysterious file mongouri.txt that contains the same information. But since only people who can access the index.js file has access to this, I have decided to rate the severity as low. I found this vulnerability when looking at source code.</p>
                <p>Solution: Remove mongouri.txt and use process.env.MONGOLAB_URI to store mongouri instead of plain text.</p>

                <h3>6. Flooding Google Maps with marker</h3>
                <p>Affects client-side (Security Issue)</p>
                <p>Severity: Low</p>
                <p>Consequences: A large number of markers concentrated in a small region on Google Maps can conver the whole map and obstruct the proper function of the website.</p>
                <p>Example: Using the following shell script, I was able to achieve the results below.</p>
                <p>#!/bin/bash<br />
                lng_range=$(awk &#39;BEGIN{for(i=-71.1214;i&lt;=-71.1189;i+=0.0001)print i}&#39;)<br />
                lat_range=$(awk &#39;BEGIN{for(i=42.4063;i&lt;=42.4089;i+=0.0001)print i}&#39;)<br />
                for lng in $lng_range<br />
                do<br />
                        for lat in $lat_range<br />
                        do<br />
                                curl --data<br /> &quot;login=lol&amp;lng=$lng&amp;lat=$lat&quot; http://thepowerfulsunblindsme.herokuapp.com/sendLocation
                        done<br />
                done<br /></p>
                <p><img class ="pic" src="flooded.png" alt="Flooding Google Maps with Markers" /></p>
                <p>Since there is no authentication nor does the web app keep track of number of checkins from a specific device, there is nothing preventing a malicious attacker from flooding the database with checkins and render the Google Maps API useless.</p>
                <p>Solution: This is beyond the scope of the assignments, but implementing a check that makes sure one device (IP adress) from sending too many requests or setting up an authentication process would both work.</p>

                <h3>7. Intercepting communication</h3>
                <p>Affects both client-side and server-side</p>
                <p>Severity: High</p>
                <p>Consequences: An attacker can intercept the request and responses between client, server, and the database. Then, the attacker can change the information contained and send the incorrect information.</p>
                <p>Example: Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was not able to figure out how to actually accomplish this. Thus, this is purely theoretical</p>
                <p>Because all information is sent through http, not https, and the different components are not on the same local network, the packets can be intercepted and changed by someone who has access to the networks where each component is located.</p>
                <p>Solution: Send information through https or set up all components on the same network (not possible within the scope of the assignment).</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>After examining my partner's web applications, I have found the above listed issues. Fortunately, most of them are easy to change by just adding a few lines of code. But, a truly secure web app would require authentication to connect and all its components would be contained on one network, with any unavoidable external communication going through https.</p>
