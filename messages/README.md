ANSWERS: It is not possible to request the data from a different origin or from
         my local machine. This is because of the same-origin policy that Ajax
         has, which prevents a web page to access data from another website or
         server that doesn't have the same-origin. "Two pages have the same
         origin if the protocol, port(if one is specified), and host are the
         same for both pages." This helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks
         and makes sure that one website doesn't access user data(e.g. cookies).
         Since the local machine is also considered as a different origin, it
         also falls under the same-origin policy.
